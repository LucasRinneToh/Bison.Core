# Bison.Core BSim Library (WIP)
This library is the Bison.Core library for the thermal energy simulation tool BSim. This library contains C# classes corresponding to the XML markdown in BSim files and can be used to build simulation model geometry and building services.

## Features
Current features:
- Write Bsim files
- Utilities to swap element attribute for multi-variate optimization

Upcoming features:
- Read BSim files

## Limitations
- BSim is not  open-sourced or free-to-use software and requires a valid licence. 
- I am not aware of any method for running simulations externally. This must be done through the BSim application UI or the batch UI. 

## Known issues
- It is a good idea to clean the model in the BSim application UI to ensure that BSim understands the model.
